//! Storage provider abstraction over object stores.
//!
//! Wraps the `object_store` crate with a narrower, supertable-
//! shaped interface exposing only the operations the supertable's
//! manifest + disk-cache layers consume:
//!
//! - `head` / `get` / `get_range` — read paths.
//! - `put_atomic` / `put_if_match` / `put_multipart` — write
//!   paths; `put_atomic` and `put_if_match` are the
//!   conditional-write primitives the manifest's OCC + the
//!   atomic-rename pointer commit ride on.
//! - `delete` — idempotent object removal.
//!
//! ## Retry contract
//!
//! Implementations inherit `object_store`'s internal bounded
//! retry of transient failures (5xx, connection-reset,
//! timeouts) under its `RetryConfig`. The `Result` returned by
//! a `StorageProvider` method therefore represents either a
//! *permanent* failure or a *transient failure that exhausted
//! the provider's retry budget*. Callers do **not** retry
//! transient errors themselves.
//!
//! The single exception is OCC on the manifest pointer:
//! [`StorageError::PreconditionFailed`] is a legitimate
//! contention signal. The supertable's commit loop catches it
//! specifically, re-reads the pointer to capture the winner's
//! state, and retries the commit on top of it.
