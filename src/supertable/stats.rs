//! Observability snapshot.
//!
//! [`Supertable::stats`] returns a [`SupertableStats`] view
//! over the supertable's current load: which manifest version
//! is pinned, how many superfiles and manifest parts are live,
//! and the OS-reported resident memory for this process.
//!
//! Stats are read-once snapshots — no internal counters reset
//! and no allocator hooks engaged. Repeat calls are cheap
//! (one syscall for RSS; everything else is an `ArcSwap::load`
//! plus length reads on the in-memory manifest cache).
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! - Manifest-side counters: pinned version, live segment
//!   count, manifest-part counts (referenced + hydrated).
//! - Process-level memory: OS-reported RSS.
//! - Disk-cache aggregates (when a cache is attached): mmap
//!   virtual size, configured budget, cumulative cold-fetch
//!   and eviction counts, current entry count.
//!
//! Per-coordinator counters (range-GETs issued, pwrites in
//! flight, foreground subscribers satisfied) and a heap-
//! resident split-out from RSS are not exposed; they require
//! query-path integration and an allocator-aware shim
//! respectively.

/// Snapshot of supertable load + process memory. Cheap to
/// produce (one RSS syscall + a manifest snapshot read).
/// Returned by-value; callers can clone or destructure freely.
