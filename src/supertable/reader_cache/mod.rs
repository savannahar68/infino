//! In-process cache of parsed `SuperfileReader`s keyed by
//! [`SuperfileUri`].
//!
//! The supertable's manifest carries metadata only — superfile id,
//! summary stats, FTS bloom, etc. The actual parsed superfile
//! readers live here, behind the [`SuperfileReaderCache`] trait,
//! owned by the supertable inner state and shared across reader
//! threads via `Arc<dyn SuperfileReaderCache>`. This split keeps
//! manifest snapshots cheap (a few KB each) while letting hot
//! queries reuse one parsed reader per superfile across threads.
//!
//! ## Implementations
//!
//! - [`InMemoryReaderCache`] — `Mutex<HashMap<...>>`-backed.
//!   Holds every superfile's bytes resident in RAM for the
//!   supertable's lifetime; no eviction. Fits the in-memory
//!   supertable shape — process restart loses the data, by
//!   design at this layer.
//! - [`DiskCacheStore`] (in [`disk`]) — mmap-backed L2 cache
//!   that pages superfiles in from an underlying storage provider
//!   on miss, evicts via [`LruPolicy`] when over budget. Used
//!   when the supertable is configured with object-store
//!   durability and wants a bounded RAM footprint.
//!
//! Both implementations return `Arc<SuperfileReader>`; they
//! differ in their backing and in their API shape (the in-memory
//! cache exposes the sync trait below; `DiskCacheStore` exposes
//! its own async surface because cold-fetch goes through tokio).
//!
//! Raw byte I/O against durable storage (S3, local FS) lives one
//! layer below in [`crate::storage::StorageProvider`]; the
//! `DiskCacheStore` is built on top of it.
