//! Typed errors for the supertable layer.
//!
//! Mirrors `superfile::error::BuildError` in shape — the
//! supertable's options-validation rules are a strict superset of
//! the superfile's, so most variants either parallel a superfile
//! variant or convert from one. The only genuinely supertable-
//! specific shapes are the `VectorColumnNotFixedSizeList` /
//! `VectorColumnDimMismatch` / `VectorColumnHasNulls` variants
//! that arise because supertable's schema includes vector columns
//! as `FixedSizeList<Float32>` (vs superfile, where vectors are
//! out-of-band entirely).
