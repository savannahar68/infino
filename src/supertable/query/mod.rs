//! Query-time machinery for the supertable.
//!
//! Each submodule owns one query shape:
//!
//! - [`sql`] — DataFusion SQL via `Supertable::query_sql`.
//! - [`fts`] — BM25 + prefix BM25 fan-out methods on
//!   [`super::SupertableReader`].
//! - [`vector`] — cluster-aware kNN fan-out method on
//!   [`super::SupertableReader`].
//!
//! All non-SQL paths return [`SuperfileHit`] tuples — `(segment_uri,
//! local_doc_id, score)`. Doc-id space is local to a segment in
//! v1, so global identity resolution is the caller's
//! responsibility.
//!
//! [`skip`] holds the manifest-only skip helpers (bloom +
//! term-range + centroid) shared across the query paths.
