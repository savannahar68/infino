//! Per-connection memory budget.
//!
//! Infino keeps data on object storage. To answer a query it pulls the
//! superfiles it needs onto local disk and memory-maps them, so most of the
//! memory a query touches is those mapped files — and the OS owns that: it
//! drops mapped pages when it needs the RAM back. What the OS *can't* reclaim
//! is the plain heap a query allocates on top — decode buffers, the vector
//! shortlist, SQL result batches, ingest buffers. Left unchecked, that heap is
//! what grows until the process is killed. This budget guards it.
//!
//! # What we track
//!
//! Only the allocations that grow with the data or the query, and a caller
//! reserves the bytes *before* it allocates them — so the budget can say no in
//! advance:
//!   - the vector shortlist fetched for a search,
//!   - SQL result / intermediate batches,
//!   - ingest buffers.
//!
//! # What we don't
//!
//! Everything already small or bounded by construction — a top-k heap holds k
//! rows, posting lists stream through, scratch is a fixed size. Reserving at
//! each of these would be noise, so we skip them and cover them with a small
//! headroom margin instead.
//!
//! That headroom is exactly why a bounded budget enforces against only **90%
//! of the value given in config** — the spare 10% absorbs all of these
//! untracked allocations. We trade exact accounting for far less plumbing, the
//! same bargain the query engines make.
//!
//! # When the budget is full
//!
//! A reservation that would cross the limit fails with [`OverBudget`]. The
//! caller turns that into a normal query error — one query fails cleanly,
//! instead of the whole process running out of memory.
//!
//! # Two modes
//!
//! Fixed when the budget is built:
//!   - **measured** ([`ConnectionMemoryBudget::measured`], the default) — counts
//!     usage so we can see it, but never refuses. No change in behaviour.
//!   - **bounded** ([`ConnectionMemoryBudget::with_limit`]) — refuses once usage
//!     would cross the ceiling. The ceiling is 90% of the configured value,
//!     leaving the 10% headroom above.
//!
//! # How it fits together
//!
//! One budget is made per connection and shared by everything that connection
//! runs at once, so what's bounded is the running total of live reservations —
//! not any single allocation. Each reservation hands its bytes back when it is
//! dropped.
//!
