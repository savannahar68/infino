//! Sync→async bridge for sync public API on top of async storage.
//!
//! The supertable's public surface (writer.commit, reader queries,
//! tombstone-cache refresh, lazy byte-source range fetches) is sync,
//! but the storage trait + downstream object_store calls are async.
//! Every call site that crosses that boundary lands here.
//!
//! ## Two modes
//!
//! - **Ambient `multi_thread` tokio runtime present** — `block_in_place`
//!   tells the scheduler "I'm about to block this worker; rearrange,"
//!   then `Handle::block_on` drives the future on the current thread.
//!   Other tasks keep making progress on sibling workers.
//! - **No ambient runtime** — build a one-shot `current_thread` runtime
//!   and drive the future on it. Sync callers (CLI tools, rayon
//!   workers, Python bindings via PyO3) land here.
//!
//! ## Unsupported: `current_thread` ambient runtime
//!
//! `tokio::task::block_in_place` requires `multi_thread`. If a caller
//! invokes this from inside a `current_thread` tokio runtime,
//! `Handle::try_current()` returns `Ok(...)`, we take the
//! `block_in_place` branch, and tokio panics. There is no good
//! detection primitive in tokio's public API for "this handle is from
//! a current_thread runtime"; surfacing a typed error would require
//! parsing `format!("{handle:?}")` or shipping our own probe. For now
//! this is a documented requirement: async callers must run on a
//! `multi_thread` runtime (the default for `#[tokio::main]`, axum,
//! actix, etc.).
